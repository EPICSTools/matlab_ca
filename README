Overview
========
MCA is an EPICS ChannelAccess client interface for Matlab.

It isn't really maintained by anybody.

Andrei Terebilo (SLAC) is the original author.
Carl Lionberger (LBL) maintained it for a while when
he was at the SNS.
Steven Banks (Australian Synchrotron Project) added
enhancements like bug fixes and switching 'put' to
use callbacks.
Ernest Williams (SNS) simplified the setup, make file etc.
Kay Kasemir (kasemirk@ornl.gov) fixed a minor array bug
and merged the 'SNS' sources with Steven's.

Compilation
===========
In principle, the Matlab 'mex' command takes care of
invoking the correct compiler & linker for your
platform and your version of Matlab.

In addition, however, we need the proper flags
to use the EPICS base includes and libraries.

At the SNS, we use the Makefile,
which supports

  make
  make install
  make clean

Then, each user has to execute
    setup.matlab
to include the library and m files for use from within matlab.

System specifics for setups that 'worked' like this:

* MacOS X 10.4, EPICS R3.14.8.2, Matlab 7.1 and 7.2.
To use the default gcc4 which was also used
to compile EPICS base:
  cp /Applications/MATLAB72/bin/mexopts.sh .
and edit mexopts.sh:
Find the CC=gcc-3.3 and CXX=g++-3.3 lines,
and remove the '-3.3', so that it's just
'gcc' resp. 'g++'.

Alternate compile scripts
=========================
There are several scripts in the alt_compile folder,
which various people have created for their site.
If the Makefile doesn't work for you,
try one of those scripts.
