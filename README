To build in the style of EPICS extensions:
type make.
type make install.

next execute setup.matlab  to include the library
and m files for use from within matlab.

Well, this is not completely in the style of the EPICS make system
but it is close enough.

TODO: Convert completely to the EPICS Makefile style for R3.14

Thanks to Kay Kasemir for his example Makefile used for the 
Matlab Channel Archiver build.
