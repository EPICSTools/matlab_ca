Matlab Channel Access (MCA)

SNS Release 3.0

Carl Lionberger 18 June 2004

This release incorporates changes done by Steven Banks of the Australian 
Synchrotron Project.  (Steven_Banks@doi.vic.gov.au).  These include 
reliability improvements due to queuing ca callbacks of matlab commands to
prevent reentrancy problems and removal of the earlier fixed limitation on the
number of channel access pv's in use.  Several examples are provided.

A simpler EPICS Makefile style build using the EPICS build environment has
been added.  This was done at SNS by Ernest Williams based on earlier work by 
Kay Kasemir.  See README file.

The mcaconn command present in some earlier SNS versions has been dropped.

There is a timestamp facility but it is somewhat different than a previous
version that was used only at SNS.

This version is known to work under linux and windows.

Our continuing thanks to Andrei Terebilo at SLAC for originally developing MCA.
